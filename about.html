            <h1>An Epitome of Excellence</h1>
            <p>The Beacon Academy is among the world's largest universities. It specializes in the application of the Harkness method of teaching and learning in its curriculum. Most of the school's classrooms contain an oval-discussion table or a similar setup where students sit facing each other. The Beacon Academy's curriculum utilizes discussion-based learning as a form of independent study in order to foster critical thinking and collaborative skills amongst its students. Leandro Locsin Jr., the school's co-founder, was an alumnus of the Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, where the method was developed. </p>
